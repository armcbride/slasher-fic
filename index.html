                                      He’s introspective and has wisdom far beyond his years, or so he thinks. He was raised in the old ways,
                                      relying on instinct and skill rather than the comforts of society. Due to all this, others often consider him an outsider or just plain “weird”. He has spent his time traveling the world and has appropriated several foreign sayings, habits, and philosophies.</p>

                                    <p>The past is the link to our future. Or at least that’s how this character views things. He makes
                                      his living by studying human cultures by recovering, documenting, analyzing, and interpreting
                                      material remains and environmental data, including architecture, artifacts and landscapes.
                                      This is, of course, a scientific definition of digging through old ruins or other sites in hopes of finding cool stuff from ages ago. The character is bookish and cerebral, often talking down to
                                      those who are not.</p>

Despite all her advantages she has been given during her life, nothing can take away the fact that she's astonishingly bird-brained, which leads to her making a fool of herself quite often.</p>
